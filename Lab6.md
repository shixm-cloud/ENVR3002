## Radiation II
{% include mathjax.html %}

In class, we explained that the absorption of radiance by a layer of gas is determined by the following equation,

\\[
I_{\lambda} = I_{\lambda 0} e^{-\tau_{\lambda}\sec\theta} = I_{\lambda 0} T_{\lambda}
\\]
where 
\\[
\tau_{\lambda} = \int_z^{z_0} k_{\lambda}\rho r\, dz
\\]
is the _normal optical depth_, and 
\\[
T_{\lambda} = e^{-\tau_{\lambda}\sec\theta} 
\\]
is transmissivity.
