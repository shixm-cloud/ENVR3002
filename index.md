## Welcome

This website hosts the coding resources of the course _Introduction to the Atmospheric Science_. A coding component is added to this course because computation is a vital component of this subject. By practicing with MATLAB, you will understand the physical concepts and principles better.

_Essential MATLAB for Engineers and Scientists_ by Brian D. Hahn and Daniel T. Valentien is a good reference book for the use of MATLAB. Examples of the first couple of lectures here closely follow this book.
