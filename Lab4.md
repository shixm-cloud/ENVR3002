### Problem 1 Specific Heats

Suppose the volume of our class room is 300 m<sup>3</sup>. For initial temperatures `T0` given be the following vector, how much heat is needed to be removed to cool the room to 21 <sup>o</sup>C?
```
T0 = [24:33]
```
Assume the pressure in the room is always the same as the pressure outside, which is constant `p = 1000` hPa. You can ignore the change in the mass of air in the room during cooling, but should be aware of the difference in initial mass (due to the difference in temperature). The specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume are 1004 and 717 J kg<sup>-1</sup> K<sup>-1</sup>, respectively.
