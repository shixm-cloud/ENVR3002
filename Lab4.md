### Problem 1 Specific Heats

Suppose the volume of our class room is 300 m<sup>3</sup>. For initial temperatures given be the following vector, how much energy is needed to cool the room to 21 <sup>o</sup>C?
```
T = [24:33]
```
Assume the pressure in the room is always the same as the pressure outside, which is `p = 1000` hPa.
