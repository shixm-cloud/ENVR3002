The objective of this class is to familiarize yourself with some of the fundamentals of MATLAB programming, including:
* Variables, operators, and expressions
* Arrays (including vectors and matrices)
* Basic input and output
* Repetition (`for`)
* Decision (`if`)

The contents of this class prepare you for coding projects in this course, as well as some scientific and engineering problems you may encounter in the future.

### Variables
